The bundles and html are generated by gulp.  So only modify the files in the `/src` directory.

## Local Development

  1. Install node
  2. Go to project root in command prompt
  3. enter 'npm install gulp -g'
  		NOTE: Something in the gulpfile.js is incompatible with version 4.  Install version 3.9.1
			sudo npm install gulp@3.9.1
  4. Run `npm install` if there are missing packages after updating from the repository.
  5. Start Gulp by running `gulp` from the project root.  It will recompile any changes made to the /src/ directory in real time.
  6. The page has to be loaded from '0.0.0.0' or 'locahost' for the fonts to display correctly.


```
# To update the code as you make changes
gulp watch

# Then to view it in the browser
gulp webserver
```

You should only work out of the `src/html` directory. Do not touch any of the root files or folders because they get built by gulp. Anytime you build, make sure to inspect the files to see that your edits made it through. Some pages have a different structure and include the footer, while others don't, for instance.
