                                    to 3 hours after bedtime. Pinworms look like small pieces of white thread on the
                                    skin. Keep in mind, pinworms are not always visible.

                                    under a microscope, so put the tape in a sealed plastic bag and take it to your
                                    doctor. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with hot, soapy water after placing
                                    the tape in the plastic bag.
