                        <p>Pinworm infections are highly contagious. That means the infection can spread easily. If one
                            person in a house gets it, others will probably get it, too. These are called outbreaks.
                            Pinworm infections tend to stick around in infected homes, daycare facilities, and
                            schools.</p><br>

                        <p>Here’s how pinworm infection spreads from one family member to another:</p>
                        <p>When the female worm lays eggs just outside the anal area, this often causes intense itching. That's
                            why the infected person will scratch his or her bottom. The eggs are sticky and hard to see.
                            Pinworm eggs cling to the person’s fingertips without anyone knowing it. Everything the
                            infected person touches, such as clothing, bedding, curtains, carpeting, towels, and
                            toilet seats can get pinworm eggs on it.</p>
