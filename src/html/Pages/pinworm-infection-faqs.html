                                        <p>You cannot take a pill in advance to prevent a pinworm infection.
                                            Because the eggs are so small, a child can bring home the eggs unknowingly
                                            from school or a friend’s house. Once your family is treated for pinworm,
                                            you can take steps to avoid reinfection.</p>
                                        <p>To help prevent reinfection follow these tips:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Wash hands thoroughly and frequently</strong> with soap and water. This is especially important after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food.</li>
											<li><strong>Cut fingernails</strong> short and avoid nail biting. Eggs collect under the fingernails. Consider buying a nail brush for each family member, and sanitize the brushes after each use.</li>
											<li><strong>Discourage children from scratching their bottoms,</strong> especially near the anal area&mdash;that's where the eggs are. If you see your kids scratching their bottoms, have them wash their hands.</li>
											<li><strong>Change and wash</strong> underwear, pajamas, towels, and bed sheets daily. Pinworm eggs can contaminate clothing and bedding.</li>
											<li><strong>Do NOT shake out towels or bed sheets.</strong> The tiny eggs can become airborne and then swallowed, which can spread the infection. Consider wearing a surgical mask when cleaning to avoid breathing in eggs.</li>
											<li><strong>Clean the bedroom floor</strong> by vacuuming or damp mopping. Avoid dry sweeping that may stir up dust.</li>
											<li><strong>Disinfect</strong> doorknobs, toilet seats, furniture, and countertops. Pinworm eggs can live indoors for up to 3 weeks.</li>

                                        <p>The most common symptom of pinworm infection is intense itching and
                                            scratching of the bottom. This extreme itching is caused by sticky pinworm
                                            eggs around the anal area. At night, some people may feel the pinworms come
                                            out to lay their eggs. This can also cause intense itching. Others with
                                            pinworm may not even know they are infected.</p>
                                        <p>People with pinworm infection may also sleep poorly, be irritable, and be
                                            restless. The intense itching and scratching of the bottom may lead to a
                                            bacterial infection. Less common signs of pinworm infection include
                                            stomach ache, teeth grinding, weight loss, bed-wetting, and pain while urinating.</p>

                                            <li>Using a flashlight, look for the worms around your child’s anal area 2 to 3
                                                hours after bedtime. Pinworms look like small pieces of white thread on
                                                the skin. Keep in mind, pinworms are not always visible.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Another way is the “tape test.” Touch the skin around the anal area with
                                                clear tape to collect eggs first thing in the morning. Pinworm eggs can
                                                only be seen under a microscope, so put the tape in a sealed plastic bag
                                                and take it to your doctor. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with

                                        <p>Pinworm can be treated with EMVERM (mebendazole). You can only get EMVERM by
                                            seeing your doctor because EMVERM is only available by prescription. EMVERM
                                            is 95% effective against pinworm.</p>
                                        <p>EMVERM comes in a chewable, kid-friendly tablet that can also be swallowed or
                                            crushed and mixed with food. Your doctor may prescribe EMVERM for everyone
                                            in the household, because others are likely to be infected.</p>
                                        <p>The dose for adults and children aged 2 years and older is the same: one
                                            100-mg tablet, taken once. If the patient is not cured 3 weeks after treatment, a second course of treatment is advised.</p>
