                                        <p>You cannot take a pill in advance to prevent a pinworm infection. Because the eggs are so small, a child can bring home the eggs unknowingly from school or a friend’s house. Once your family is treated for pinworm, you can take steps to avoid reinfection.</p>
                                        <p>To help prevent reinfection, follow these tips:</p>
                                        <ol class="faq-ol">
                                            <li><strong>Wash hands thoroughly and frequently</strong> with soap and water. This is especially important after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food.<sup class="super">2</sup></li>
											<li><strong>Cut fingernails</strong> short and avoid nail biting. Eggs collect under the fingernails. Consider buying a nail brush for each family member, and sanitize the brushes after each use.<sup class="super">4</sup></li>
											<li><strong>As much as possible, discourage children from scratching their bottoms,</strong> especially near the anal area—that’s where the eggs are. If you see your kids scratching their bottoms, have them wash their hands.<sup class="super">4</sup></li>
											<li><strong>Change and wash</strong> underwear, pajamas, towels, and bed sheets daily. Pinworm eggs can contaminate clothing and bedding.<sup class="super">2</sup></li>
											<li><strong>Do NOT shake out towels or bed sheets.</strong> The tiny eggs can become airborne and inhaled or deposited onto food and swallowed, which can spread the infection. Consider wearing a surgical mask when cleaning to avoid breathing in eggs.<sup class="super">2,4</sup></li>
											<li><strong>Clean the bedroom floor</strong> by vacuuming or damp mopping. Avoid dry sweeping, which may stir up dust.<sup class="super">4</sup></li>
											<li><strong>Disinfect</strong> doorknobs, toilet seats, furniture, countertops, cell phones, remote controls, and other shared surfaces the infected person may have touched, as eggs can survive <strong>up to 3 weeks</strong> on indoor surfaces.<sup class="super">2</sup></li>
