                        <p>Pinworms—also known as <span class="italic">seat worms</span> and <span class="italic">threadworms</span>—are
                            little parasites. When a person is infected with pinworms, the eggs hatch and the small,
                            thin, white worms grow and live inside the intestine.</p>
                        <p>When someone has pinworms, it is also known as a <span

                        <p>While a person sleeps, female pinworms crawl out of a person’s bottom to lay thousands of
                            eggs. The tiny, sticky pinworm eggs are laid just outside in the anal area. This can lead to
                            intense itching and scratching.</p>
                        <p>
                            Once a person touches pinworm eggs, usually from scratching his or her bottom, the eggs can be
                            spread to other objects and surfaces without anyone knowing it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pinworm eggs are so sticky, they can cling to toys, bedding, towels, clothing, and lots of
                            other things people share every day. That's how pinworm infection spreads so easily from
                            person to person.</p>
