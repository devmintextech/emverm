                        <p>Eggs are swallowed, usually after hand-to-mouth contact, and the pinworm infection begins

                        <h2>How to avoid pinworm reinfection</h2>
                        <p>Avoiding pinworm reinfection should be discussed with your doctor at the time of treatment.
                            Good hand hygiene is one of the most effective means of preventing pinworm reinfection.</p>

                            <img src="../images/ProtectingYourHousehold/img_WashHands.png" class="img-responsive center"

                        </div>
                        <p>Since pinworm can come back, doctors may prescribe a second course of treatment. Besides
                            the infected person, your doctor may also want to treat other children in the house or all
                            family members, including adults. The medicine used to treat pinworm infection kills the
                            pinworms, but not the eggs. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe 2 courses of
                            treatment about 3 weeks apart to prevent any reinfection.</p>
                        <p>This means each person in the home would receive the same 2-dose pinworm treatment.
