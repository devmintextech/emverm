				<h1>Before you take EMVERM, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</h1>

				</ul>
        <p><strong class="emphasis">Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take</strong>, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.<br/>
